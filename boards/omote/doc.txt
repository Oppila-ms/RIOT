# Porting status

In terms of hardware support, the following drivers have been implemented
for CC2538 System-on-Chip:

- UART
- Random number generator
- Low Power Modes
- General-Purpose Timers
- I2C/SPI library
- LEDs
- Buttons
- RF 2.4GHz built-in in CC2538
  RP-SMA

##  Flashing and Debugging

Currently RIOT supports flashing the OpenMote using a Segger JLink JTAG
adapter or via USB, using the bootloader on the board.

### Flashing via JTAG

To be able to flash the board via JTAG you need to install Seggers JLinkExe
tool. Once you have this in place, you can simply flash by calling

### Flashing via USB

The omote has built-in support to flash over USB using the BSL.It requires to unlock the bootloader by manually pressing the `BSL
button` and `reset button`

Bash
$ make BOARD=omote flash
```
The omote has 13 burgs pinouts to connect boolean,digital and analog sensors based on I2C,UART,and SPI Protocols as well as other sensors or actuators you may need to connect.
