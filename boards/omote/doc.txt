@brief       Support for the omote board

# Components

| MCU   | [CC2538 (ARM Cortex-M3 with on-board 2.4GHz radio)](http://www.ti.com/product/CC2538) |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Radio | ISM 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4: (http://www.ti.com/product/CC2538) & Zig-Bee compliant radio |
| Antenna | On-board PCB antenna (2.4GHz) |
| USB-to-Serial | [CP2104](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/cp2104.pdf) |
| Peripherals | BMP180, ADXL345 and LDR |
| Others | LED, Buttons |

# Porting status

In terms of hardware support, the following drivers have been implemented
for CC2538 System-on-Chip:

- UART
- General-Purpose Timers
- I2C/SPI library
- LEDs
- Buttons
- RF 2.4GHz built-in in CC2538

##  Flashing and Debugging

Currently RIOT supports flashing the omote using a Segger JLink JTAG
adapter or via USB, using the bootloader on the board.

### Flashing via JTAG

To be able to flash the board via JTAG you need to install Seggers JFlashLite
tool. Once you have this in place, you can simply flash by calling
	$ JFlashLite

### Flashing via USB

The omote has built-in support to flash over USB using the BSL.It requires to unlock the bootloader by manually pressing the `BSL
button` and `reset button`

Bash
$ make BOARD=omote flash

The omote has 13 burgs pinouts to connect boolean,digital and analog sensors based on I2C,UART,and SPI Protocols as well as other sensors or actuators you may need to connect.
